📊 General Trends
How have shark attacks changed over time?
(e.g., Are they increasing or decreasing? Has media attention affected reporting?)

Which countries or regions have the highest number of shark attacks?

What months or seasons have the highest frequency of attacks?

🚨 Situational Factors
What human activities are most associated with shark attacks?
(e.g., surfing, swimming, diving)

Do attacks happen more often to men or women?

What time of day do most attacks occur?

📍 Geographic Patterns
Where are the global hotspots for shark attacks? (heatmap-style)

Are there specific beaches or coastlines that are more dangerous than others?

🐋 If You Use Shark Tracking Data (like OCEARCH or OBIS):
📍 Migration & Movement
What are the migration patterns of certain shark species over the year?

How far do tagged sharks travel, and how fast?

Do sharks return to the same locations year after year?

🧬 Species Behavior
Do different species have different patterns in location, depth, or temperature preference?

Are some species more active or mobile than others?

🌍 If You Combine with Environmental or Conservation Data:
Is there a correlation between ocean temperature changes and shark movement?

Which shark species are most at risk of extinction?

How does human activity (like fishing zones) overlap with shark habitats?

Which countries have the highest number of endangered shark species?

🎯 Bonus (For a More Engaging Portfolio Project)
Can we predict the likelihood of a shark attack based on time, location, and activity?
(Mini machine learning model idea!)

What misconceptions do people have about shark attacks vs. the actual data?
(Great for a blog post or data storytelling angle)
