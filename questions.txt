📊 General Trends
How have shark attacks changed over time?
(e.g., Are they increasing or decreasing? Has media attention affected reporting?)

Which countries or regions have the highest number of shark attacks?

What months or seasons have the highest frequency of attacks?

🚨 Situational Factors
What human activities are most associated with shark attacks?
(e.g., surfing, swimming, diving)

Do attacks happen more often to men or women?

What time of day do most attacks occur?

📍 Geographic Patterns
Where are the global hotspots for shark attacks? (heatmap-style)

Are there specific beaches or coastlines that are more dangerous than others?

🐋 If You Use Shark Tracking Data (like OCEARCH or OBIS):
📍 Migration & Movement
What are the migration patterns of certain shark species over the year?

How far do tagged sharks travel, and how fast?

Do sharks return to the same locations year after year?

🧬 Species Behavior
Do different species have different patterns in location, depth, or temperature preference?

Are some species more active or mobile than others?

🌍 If You Combine with Environmental or Conservation Data:
Is there a correlation between ocean temperature changes and shark movement?

Which shark species are most at risk of extinction?

How does human activity (like fishing zones) overlap with shark habitats?

Which countries have the highest number of endangered shark species?

🎯 Bonus (For a More Engaging Portfolio Project)
Can we predict the likelihood of a shark attack based on time, location, and activity?
(Mini machine learning model idea!)

What misconceptions do people have about shark attacks vs. the actual data?
(Great for a blog post or data storytelling angle)

Demographic & Victim Analysis 👥
Age Trends: Which age group (Child/Adult) is most vulnerable to shark attacks? Does this vary by country or activity?

Gender Differences Over Time: Has the male/female victim ratio changed over decades?

Survival Analysis: Are certain age groups or genders more likely to survive an attack? How does injury severity correlate with survival?

Age vs. Activity: Do children and adults engage in different activities when attacked (e.g., swimming vs. surfing)?

Species & Biology 🦈
Species-Specific Attacks: Which shark species are most frequently involved in fatal attacks? Are certain species more common in specific regions?

Misidentification: How often is the shark species listed as "Unknown"? Could this correlate with reporting biases?

Species vs. Activity: Do certain species target specific activities (e.g., great whites and surfing)?

Seasonal Migration: Do attacks from migratory species (e.g., bull sharks) spike during certain months?

Environmental & Ecological Factors 🌊
Water Conditions: Are attacks more frequent in areas with specific environmental features (e.g., murky water, estuaries, coral reefs)?

Proximity to Rivers: Do attacks cluster near river mouths (common bull shark habitats)?

Climate Impact: Has climate change (e.g., rising sea temps) influenced attack frequency or locations over time?

Activity & Human Behavior 🏄
Activity Risk: Beyond broad categories (surfing/swimming), which specific activities (e.g., spearfishing, kiteboarding) have the highest fatality rates?

Group vs. Solo: Are attacks more likely when people are alone or in groups?

Protective Gear: Do activities involving gear (e.g., wetsuits, dive cages) correlate with lower injury severity?

Temporal Patterns ⏰
Holidays/Weekends: Do attacks spike during holidays or weekends when beach attendance is higher?

Decadal Trends: How do attack rates compare across decades (e.g., 1990s vs. 2010s)?

Lunar Cycles: Is there a correlation between moon phases (full moon/new moon) and attack frequency?

Geographic & Cultural Insights 🌍
Urban vs. Remote: Do attacks occur more near urbanized coastlines or remote areas? Does this correlate with rescue response times?

Tourism Impact: Do countries with high tourism (e.g., Australia, South Africa) have disproportionately higher attack rates?

Local Policies: Do regions with shark mitigation strategies (e.g., nets, drones) see fewer attacks over time?

Data Quality & Reporting 📝
Reporting Bias: How does media coverage (e.g., "Summer of the Shark" in 2001) correlate with spikes in reported incidents?

Missing Data: What percentage of entries have incomplete data (e.g., unknown species, time, or country)? Does this skew trends?

"Invalid" Cases: What defines an "invalid" attack in your dataset? Are these false alarms or misreported incidents?

Predictive & Risk Modeling 🔮
Risk Score: Can you create a risk score for beaches based on historical attacks, species presence, and human activity?

Fatalities Predictor: What factors (e.g., species, injury type, response time) best predict whether an attack will be fatal?
